# Thesis

This repository contains all scripts used in the projects related to my doctorate thesis in Forensic Science entitled 
The Evaluation of Mobile Device Evidence under Person-Level, Location-Focused Propositions

This thesis is currently being finished and handed in to the committee. As soon as it is in it's final form, the pdf will be referenced here for context as well. 

This repository is of purely archivary nature. The scripts are not maintained and will not be updated.
Research projects based on scripts in this repository will be placed in a dedicated repository.
